# Step 1: Functional Programming

Functional programming is a very different method of programming than the traditional, imperative programming that one thinks of. 

In imperative programming, each line of code tells the computer exactly what to do. This makes programming very procedural, because the programmer focus on what they need the code to do and write to achieve those actions. Common languages of imperative programming are C++ and Java. 

For functional programming, lines of code explain how to do something, rather than what. Everything is an expression, meaning that everything evaluates to something. Haskell will be the language used in this blog. 

These short descriptions may be confusing, so I found an analogy on a Stack Overflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17826380/what-is-difference-between-functional-and-imperative-programming-languages). The response details how you would think of imperative programming versus functional programming. For example, in imperative programming, you would have a designated step of actions, such as grabbing your keys, openning your garage, and starting your car. In functional programming, the idea of how things works is what you would have: keys are used to unlock things, car are made as a mode of transportation, the garage is a storage unit.
