# Haskell Blog

## Background
This blog is a progression of experiences related to learning about Haskell and programming languages. Before discussing anything about my experiences with Haskell and functional programming, it is important to establish some background. My computer is on Windows 10 Education, running with a 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor, and 12 GB RAM. I use Atom as my text editor and the Windows PowerShell for commands.
